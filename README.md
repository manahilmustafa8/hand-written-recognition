# hand-written-recognition
Handwritten digit recognition uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of digits (0â€“9). Each image is 28x28 pixels. A machine learning model, often a neural network like CNN, is trained to recognize these digits by learning patterns in the images. This task demonstrates how deep learning can accurately classify handwritten numbers.
